This is the readme file for using the programs. Please follow the following guidelines:

1. Place the input and locations file, in the parent folder after unzipping.
2. Run the program named NewSample.java

PS: The efficiency of the program is highly questionable considering I didn't find enough time to work on the question sample. Although, the I roughly estimate the efficiency to be ~60-70% i.e. about 0.6-0.7 for large sets of data. Additionally, the running time is also sub-optimal, owing to same reason as mentioned before.
