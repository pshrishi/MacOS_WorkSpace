This folder has 6 files and you are reading the README file.

1) crfModelTrain and crfModelTest are two shell scripts use to train an already installed crf++ software. You can search "crf++" on google to get to crf++'s homepage.
2) DevelopTrainData.java is the file containing code to read an input tagged raw text to a feature vector representation text file. The feature vector representation contains each token, with its associated features seperated by tabs, on a new line.
3) FeatureVectorGenerator.java is the file where you can define your features and depending on the token return an appropriate feature vector to DevelopTrainData.java
4) DevelopTaggedOutputVariant.java contains the code to convert back from the feature vector representation of text to normal running text. This can be used once the tagging is done by a trained classifier and you want to convert to the raw tagged text form for evaluation.
